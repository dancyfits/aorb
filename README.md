[Demo](https://dancyfits.github.io/aorb/)

Try adding some movies or bands you like.  Then click one of the two options to rank your favorites!  Allows for differing opinions (you and your partner can't figure out where to get dinner?). The more you pick the more accurate your results will be.

A non-transitive information comparison system.  Takes a list and allows you to pick between two list items at a time to rank the list.  Currently uses the ELO rating algorithm (how chess players get their rating).  Advantage is it accounts for answers that for whatever reason compete with a previous one (i.e. You rated Kung Fu Panda higher than Inception, but your girlfriend disagreed...)

Sensical explanation coming soon.
